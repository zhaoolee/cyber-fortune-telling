## How to Use These Rules

### 1. Main Configuration
The primary `.cursorrules` file in the project root references these specialized rules and provides a comprehensive overview for the AI assistant.

### 2. Context-Aware Development
When working on specific parts of the project, the AI will automatically apply the relevant rules:
- Frontend work ‚Üí `frontend-rules.md`
- Backend development ‚Üí `backend-rules.md`
- AI integration ‚Üí `ai-integration-rules.md`
- Deployment tasks ‚Üí `docker-deployment-rules.md`

### 3. Cultural Sensitivity
Special attention is given to Chinese traditional elements throughout all rules, ensuring culturally appropriate:
- Lunar calendar calculations
- Ba Zi (Eight Characters) analysis
- Feng shui ornament recommendations
- Traditional terminology usage

## Key Features Covered

### üîÆ Fortune Telling Logic
- Birth chart analysis using Chinese astrology
- Daily fortune generation with AI
- Personalized recommendations
- Cultural context integration

### üéØ AI Integration
- DeepSeek API integration patterns
- Prompt engineering best practices
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Response validation and processing

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- Full-stack Next.js + Strapi setup
- PostgreSQL database management
- Docker containerization
- PWA capabilities

### üé® User Experience
- Material-UI component patterns
- Framer Motion animations
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility considerations

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp example.env .env

# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Development
- Frontend: `cd frontend && pnpm dev`
- Backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
- Database: Access via Docker Compose

### 3. Testing
- Unit tests for utilities
- Component testing
- API integration testing
- AI functionality testing

## Best Practices Enforced

### Code Quality
- TypeScript usage where applicable
- Proper error handling
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Respectful handling of traditional beliefs
- Accurate lunar calendar calculations
- Appropriate feng shui representations
- Educational context provision

### AI Integration
- Robust prompt engineering
- Fallback mechanisms
- Response validation
- Rate limiting and caching

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **AI API failures**: Check API keys and rate limits
2. **Database connection**: Verify Docker containers are running
3. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 4000 and 1337 are available
4. **Environment variables**: Verify all required variables are set

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Access database
docker-compose exec database psql -U strapi -d fortune_telling
```

## Contributing

When adding new rules or modifying existing ones:

1. **Maintain consistency** with existing patterns
2. **Include practical examples** with code snippets
3. **Consider cultural sensitivity** for Chinese elements
4. **Update the main `.cursorrules`** file if needed
5. **Test the rules** with actual development scenarios

## Support
